Single-phase power represents a type of alternating current (AC) distribution system where electrical energy is transmitted using a single sinusoidal waveform.
This configuration is commonly employed in residential, small commercial, and light industrial settings.


Three-phase power represents a robust and efficient method of alternating current (AC) distribution. Three-phase systems employ three separate waveforms, each
with a 120-degree phase. This configuration is the preferred choice for a wide range of industrial and commercial applications.


Energy storage batteries are designed to store electrical energy effieiently, offering a crucial means to balance supply and demand on power grids and enhance the integration
of renewable energy sources.
